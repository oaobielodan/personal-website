        <b><a href=https://github.com/oaobielodan/musical-scenes>[Muscial Scenes]</a></b>
        <p>For this project, I created a website where users can create a “muscial scene”. Inspired by games such as Incredibox and My Singing Monsters, the user can choose from four flowers that represent four instuments (synth, piano, guitar, violin). These flowers are placed by the user on a background and where they are placed on the y-axis determines the pitch of the flower. When they press play, an airplane flies over the field, ‘playing’ the flowers.</p>
