                    Musical Scenes is an interactive web experience where users create visual compositions
                    that generate music. Users select from four flower icons, each representing a distinct
                    instrument, and place them in a 2D digital field. In doing this, users shape both the 
                    timing and pitch of the resulting musical sequence.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            
            <h4>Initial Idea:</h4>
            <p>
                Musical Scenes was inspired by interactive music games like Incredibox and My Singing Monsters, 
                where users build unique soundscapes by combining predesigned elements. The original concept was
                for a sandbox environment where players could place various objects (e.g. planes, animals, or 
                plants) into a scene. During playback, these elements would be animated, and their speed, size, 
                and position would dynamically influence the musical output. The final deliverable is a more focused 
                variation of this concept.
            </p>

            <h4>What Changed:</h4>
            <p>
                The initial implementation of Musical Scenes had the notes playing continuously, with no coherent 
                melioidotic outcome. To address this, I collaborate with my professor at the time to redesign the 
                system. The revised concept features a field of flowers with a plane flying across it. Each flowerâ€™s 
                vertical position (y-axis) corresponds to pitch, while the horizontal position (x-axis) determines 
                when the note is triggered, based on when the plane passes over it. Additionally, each flower type 
                represents a different instrument. The current version includes four instruments: synth, piano, guitar, 
                and violin.
