                    The idea for my project was to create a shape-changing flowerpot that would help users
                    understand the current health of their plants. In the end, I created a notification system that
                    visually showed users when the soil in their planter was too dry for their plants. The final product
                    was a planter stand that has a picture attached to it. When the moisture level of the plant soil is
                    too dry, the picture is broken up and not fully visible. However, whenever the user waters their
                    plant and the moisture level returns to where it needs to be, the picture fixes itself and can be
                    plainly seen. If the moisture level of the soil goes above the dry threshold again the picture will
                    go back to being broken up.
